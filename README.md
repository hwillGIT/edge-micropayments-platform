# EMPIC SDK – Getting Started

Welcome to the **EMPIC SDK**. This package provides developers with the tools to experiment with **Edge Micropayments Platform for Integrated Commerce (EMPIC)**. It includes device simulation, escrow flows, and a set of plugins for building and testing micropayment-enabled IoT applications.

EMPIC is a Layer 3 micropayment protocol that enables IoT devices and online services to exchange data and functionality via escrow‑protected stablecoin payments. Devices (consumers) discover services (providers) in a registry, negotiate price via an oracle, lock funds in an escrow contract, and then exchange data. Stablecoin escrow ensures predictable pricing, while decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and zero‑knowledge rollups secure identities and minimize gas costs. Although the SDK abstracts these blockchain details, it is important to understand the high‑level workflow:
    1. Registration – Each device authenticates with a SERVICE_API_KEY issued by the EMPIC portal.
       
    2. Service discovery – Consumers query a registry for providers matching a desired service_tag (e.g., "weather" or "temperature").
       
    3. Escrow creation – Once a provider is chosen, the consumer deposits USDC into an escrow smart contract on a Layer 2 rollup.
       
    4. Data exchange – Providers deliver data via pull or pubsub modes. Consumers validate the data against an SLA.
       
    5. Settlement – Upon successful validation, the escrow releases funds to the provider and publishes a proof to the Ethereum Layer 1.
This architecture enables real‑time, low‑cost micropayments for IoT data and services. Developers focus only on device logic while EMPIC handles identity, pricing, escrows, settlement and fraud prevention.

This README will guide you through setup, configuration, and running your first demo client.

## 1. Get the Resources You’ll Need

1. **Register with EMPIC for an API key**  
   You must have a valid API key to use EMPIC services. Register on the EMPIC portal (http://edgemicropayments.ddns.net) to obtain one.

2. **Download the EMPIC SDK archive**  
   Once you have an API key, you can follow links on the EMPIC portal to download the SDK archive. You should have a file named something like (your version will reflect the latest SDK release):
   ```bash
   empic_sdk_demo-x.x.x.tgz
   ```

3. **Extract the archive**  
   Create a project directory and extract:
   ```bash
   tar zxvf empic_sdk_demo-x.x.x.tgz
   ```

   This extraction will create the following directory structure:
   .
   ├── empic_sdk-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
   ├── plugins
   │   ├── bin
   │   │   ├── run_custom_weather_consumer.sh
   │   │   ├── run_custom_weather_service.sh
   │   │   ├── run_custom_temperature_consumer.sh
   │   |   └── run_custom_temperate_service.sh
   │   ├── configs
   │   │   ├── plugin_temperature_consumer.json
   │   │   ├── plugin_temperature_service.json

   │   └── temperature_sensor.py
   ├── python_util-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
   ├── README.md
   └── requirements.txt

4. *(Optional but recommended)* Create a Python virtual environment to sandbox your development:
   - Using **conda**:
     ```bash
     conda create -n empic-sdk-demo python=3.12
     conda activate empic-sdk-demo
     ```
   - Using **pip venv**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv empic-sdk-demo
     source env/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
     .\env\Scripts\activate    # Windows
     ```

5. **Uninstall any previous version of the EMPIC SDK and install the latest**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall empic-sdk
   python -m pip install --force-reinstall empic_sdk-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

6. **Uninstall any previous version of the EMPIC python utilities and install the latest**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall -y python-util
   python -m pip install --force-reinstall python_util-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

7. **Install required third-party Python modules**  
   From your project directory:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2. Configure the Temperature and Weather Sensor Clients (i.e., data/service consumers)

The simplest way to get started is to use either the **temperature sensor plugin consumer** or **weather sensor plugin consumer** included in the SDK. Beginning your use of this SDK, it's advised to start with a simple consumer implementation. When you've reached an understanding of that you can also implement provider implementations.

Edit the configuration file, for example:
`plugins/configs/plugin_temperature_consumer.json`
or
`plugins/configs/plugin_weather_consumer.json`

Key fields to update:

```jsonc
"SERVICE_API_KEY": "<replace with your API service key>",*

* [Note: if you have multiple consumers and providers, it may be more convenient to specify a single
  API service key in a .env file in the root of your project directory. Doing this will enable
  you to use the same key for multiple data consumers and service providers. If you choose this
  approach, remove the SERVICE_API_KEY entry from the json configuration files for your
  consumers and service providers.

"port": <replace with your custom port, e.g., 9074>,
"debugpy_port": <replace with your custom debug port, e.g., 3344>,
"signing_url": "http://<replace with accessible URL, e.g. mydevice.somewhere.net:<port>>/sign",
"data_receipt_url": "http://<replace with public URL, e.g. mydevice.somewhere.net:<port>>/receive-data",

"wallets": [
  {
    "name": "<Replace with your wallet name, e.g., My Weather Wallet>",
    "address": "<Replace with your wallet’s blockchain address>

    Note:  During development, you will be utilizing EMPIC's devnet (i.e., dev blockchain), and thus
           you can define your own wallet addresses. These should conform to the following pattern:
           "0x" followed by 40 valid hexademical characters (i.e., A-F, a-f,0-9)
           For example: 0x8Ae84Fc75e27Bee36FB8E5F3031618434cfc0226
           Be aware that every device in your system should utilize its own unique
           wallet addresses. Doing otherwise may result in unexpected behavior and errors.
  }
],

"notifications": {
  "emails": ["<Replace with your email address to receive wallet alerts>"]
}

"funding_mode": "auto_fill"

   Note: By default, the EMPIC develpment environment provides this auto-fill funding mechanism for 
         required USDC and ETH account balances. This behavior is configurable, and if you wish 
         instead to be notified of a wallet's insufficient balance for transactions, you can configure 
         this field to "notify_low_funds" and an alert will be sent to the email addresses listed in 
         the "notifications" element". In production mode, "notify_low_funds" is the default, and upon
	 receipt of low fund email notification, you will need to ensure that your wallet is sufficiently
	 funded for continued use.

"port", and 
"debugpy_port"
⚠️ **Important**: Ensure the `port` and `debugpy_port` are unique and not used by other services. Doing
    otherwise will result in runtime and/or debugging failures.

For example:

"consumers": [
  {
    "class": "plugins.plugin_temperature_consumer.PluginTemperatureConsumer",
    "service_tag": "temperature",
    "delivery_mode note": "as desired: pull | pubsub",
    "delivery_mode": "pubsub"
  }

   Note: As you develop your own consumers and service providers, the "class" field above will be
         used to specify the python implmentation to be executed in conjunction with the
	 json configuration. This allows the runtime logic to be specified in the python code,
	 while device-specific configuration is specified in the json files. This allows
	 you to run multiple configurations for the same underlying python logic execution.

```

---

## 3. Run the Demo Consumer

Once your configuration has been customized to your needs, start the consumer with:

```bash
./plugins/bin/run_custom_temperature_consumer.sh
```

or

```bash
./plugins/bin/run_custom_weather_consumer.sh
```

These script will execute the command to start the python process and apply the customzed configuration
to it. The script also defines an output log file which is written to the project root directory.

Upon startup, the consumer will register itself with the EMPIC platform, request available services tagged with the string found in the "service_tag" JSON configuration element. Your wallet will be self-funding from an EMPIC platform funding faucet. The weather consumer will establish a connection with the discovered weather service, and begin a series of requests for weather data.

---

## 4. Development and Debugging in VSCode

A `.vscode/launch.json` is included for debugging. Launch Visual Studio Code from your project directory:

```bash
code .
```

Select the desired debug configuration from the VSCode debug dropdown (F5). Set breakpoints in your code and debug directly in the EMPIC SDK environment.

---

## 5. How the Weather Consumer Works in Detail

The file `plugin_weather_consumer.py` implements the **PluginWeatherConsumer** class.  

Here’s what it does:

- **Service Targeting**  
  ```python
  service_tag = "weather"
  ```  
  The plugin declares that it wants to consume a services tagged as `"weather"`.

- **Service Selection (`select_services`)**  
  Filters available providers and chooses the **cheapest one under 0.50 USDC**.

- **Request Parameters (`get_request_params`)**  
  Supplies runtime parameters (like latitude and longitude) from your config file (`plugin_weather_consumer.json`).  
  By default, it requests weather data using "lat" and "lon" parameters for **New York City**.

- **Data Consumption (`consume`)**  
  Logs the weather data payload once it’s delivered.

- **Data Validation (`_is_data_acceptable`)**  
  Accepts only weather responses where `temperature_c >= -30`. This acts as a simple Service-Level Agreement (SLA) check of sensor integrity. If the service data is validated successfully, the EMPIC platform will release your escrowed funds to the service provider

- **Post-Processing (`handle_data`)**  
  - Logs the full data snapshot

## 6. Workflow Diagram

Below is the workflow of the Weather Consumer plugin:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[plugin_weather_consumer.json] -->|Config loaded| B[PluginWeatherConsumer]
    B --> C[select_services: Choose cheapest provider < 0.50 USDC]
    B --> D[get_request_params: Supply lat/lon]
    D -->|Params sent| E[Provider Service]
    E -->|Weather data| F[_is_data_acceptable: Check temp >= 0]
    F -->|Valid| G[consume: Log raw weather data]
    G --> H[handle_data: Add location & pretty-print]
```

---

## 7. Next Steps

- **Customize** your own consumer by using `plugin_weather_consumer.py` as a starting point. Things you may try:
  - Change the SLA logic in `_is_data_acceptable`
  - Modify `select_services` to choose based on other criteria (e.g., reputation, latency)
  - Add new handling logic in `handle_data`

- **Explore other plugins** in the `plugins/` directory (e.g., the Weather Service) or create your own. Any new data consumer/generator can be added to a JSON config and run with `device_manager` as demonstrated in ./plugins/bin/run_weather_consumer.sh and ./plugins/bin/run_weather_service.sh .

- **Integrate with other EMPIC-enabled IoT devices** by replacing the example weather use case with your own device or data source.

## 9. Enhanced Features & Recent Updates

### 🆕 Delivery-Mode Specific Pricing (NEW)

The EMPIC SDK now supports different pricing models for different delivery modes:

- **Pull Mode:** $0.01 per pull request event
- **Pubsub Mode:** $0.40 per escrow event (covers entire subscription duration)

#### Configuration Example:
```json
"pricing": {
  "pull": {
    "price_usdc": 0.01,
    "billing_model": "per_pull_event"
  },
  "pubsub": {
    "price_usdc": 0.40,
    "billing_model": "per_escrow_event"
  }
}
```

### 🆕 Pull Request Cadence Support (NEW)

Added `cadence_sec` parameter to consumer configurations to control the periodicity of pull requests:

```json
"consumers": [{
  "delivery_mode": "pull",
  "cadence_sec": 30,
  "class": "plugins.plugin_consumer.PluginConsumer"
}]
```

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Multiprocessing Compatibility Fix
- **Issue:** Python 3.13 + Windows + FastAPI incompatibility
- **Solution:** Use WSL Linux with fork() multiprocessing
- **Implementation:** Added wrapper scripts (`run_*.py`) with proper multiprocessing setup
